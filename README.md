# tampermonkey-script-amazon-price-helper

Tampermonkey user script to view a price history chart as well as compare prices between stores from different countries.

You’ll understand it better with an example. This is a product page from Amazon:

<img width="1482" height="994" alt="01-without-script" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1aab98-cf77-4f13-b78c-85910f938ed5" />

And this is how you would see it once the script is installed:

<img width="2501" height="1777" alt="02-with-script" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8f3c083-29b9-4648-bc56-a637736b7225" />

# Install / update

You just need to have the [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension installed and click on this link:

https://github.com/aportela/tampermonkey-script-amazon-price-helper/raw/refs/heads/main/tampermonkey-script-amazon-price-helper.user.js

It’s possible that you’ll see an alert message from TamperMonkey notifying you that an script it’s trying to access a cross-origin resource (this is because the script makes a background request to the Hagglezone website to fetch the price comparison)
