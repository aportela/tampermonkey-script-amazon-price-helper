# tampermonkey-script-amazon-price-helper

Tampermonkey user script to view a price history chart as well as compare prices between stores from different countries.

You’ll understand it better with an example. This is a product page from Amazon:

And this is how you would see it once the script is installed:

# Install / update

You just need to have the [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension installed and click on this link:

https://github.com/aportela/tampermonkey-script-amazon-price-helper/raw/refs/heads/main/tampermonkey-script-amazon-price-helper.user.js

It’s possible that you’ll see an alert message from TamperMonkey notifying you that an script it’s trying to access a cross-origin resource (this is because the script makes a background request to the Hagglezone website to fetch the price comparison)
